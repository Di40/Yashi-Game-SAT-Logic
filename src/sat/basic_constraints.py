def generate_yashi_basic_constraints(graph, lines, points, pointsToLine):
    """
        Generate fundamental constraints for a Yashi game.

        Parameters:
        - graph (Graph): The graph representing the game board's structure.
        - lines (Lines): A dictionary mapping line identifiers to pairs of points.
        - points (Points): A list of points in the puzzle.
        - pointsToLine (PointsToLine): A dictionary mapping points to the lines they belong to.

        Returns:
        - phi (WCNF): The WCNF formula representing the core constraints of the Yashi game.

        This function generates fundamental constraints for solving a Yashi game, where players connect points
        with lines while adhering to specific rules. The constraints include:

        1. No_crossing constraints: Lines must not cross each other.
        2. No_cycles constraints: The game board's structure should not contain cycles (loops).
        3. Exactly_n-1 constraints: Exactly  nâˆ’1  lines must be used to connect the points.

        The combined WCNF formula enforces these constraints and can be used by a SAT solver to solve the Yashi puzzle.
